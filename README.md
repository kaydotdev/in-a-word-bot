## Description

Finding the right information in the **digital era** may be the real challenge nowadays because it's growing **exponentially** day by day! Whether you are a student preparing an essay or a researcher working with the knowledge base, you spend a lot of time searching, filtering, and summarizing text. [Google](https://www.google.com/) can assist you with the first two steps, but I will help with the last one! Send me a plain text, file, or link to an external resource, and I will summarize it for you in a word :grin:.
